FBTest queries Facebook for friendship photos between the user and a friend.

Once cloned to your system...
If you go to http://localhost/3000/home you can put your access token and a friend's facebook ID to see facebook photos. To obtain access token, go to https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer and approve "user_photos" and "friends_photos".  To find a friend's facebook ID, add the field "friends" to the graph API explorer.

Next steps are making it so that users do not need to go get an access token and can find a friend through a search bar instead of by entering an id number.
